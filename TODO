TODO:

Plan:
* Do ncurses output
* Add more stats

later. Add error message for no log found
later. Add sensible defaults for log and especially database, change Usage accordingly
later. Add support for reading initial values of log
later. Do packaging and installation

Application skeleton
    (**)Add color and styling to output
        Clear strings before update
        Add checks for how wide the screen is and truncate strings accordingly
            Length of Traffic depends on domain size, but the minimum is 17 wide
            Borders are 4 wide
            Length of alert kinda depends on # hits but typically should be 65 + #digits, so no more than 70 depending on threshold
            Stats section should be as wide as traffic section
            So, our min total is 17 + 4 + 17 + 70 = 104 wide.
            For now, just truncate, and add a todo to use pads
    (**)Package up file into something useable
        How to install daemon?
        How to start/stop daemon?
        How to install application?
        How to uninstall everything?
    (DONE)Read file and update with file changes
        See this for initial application: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/157035-tail-f-in-python/
        Or this (section 5): http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/ 
        Try pnotify later for less CPU usage: https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify
    (DONE)Output to console, changing every 10s
        curses package: curses/ncurses
    (DONE)Make sure app can be kept running, as a daemon perhaps? No need.
        On daemons: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/1.5.5
            http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/
        Perhaps a separate daemon for aggregating data, and a program for running
        output. Clarify on this.
            The daemon will keep up to date on logs and update a stats file.
            Every 10s, the monitor will read the stats file.
                Do the alerts need to be real time or on the next 10s update? On update.
                If real time, then monitor needs to also keep up to date w/ stats file.
Logic
    (*)Come up with summary statistics and calculate (look at other applications)
        See Google Analytics, add actual summary statistics like mean, mode, range etc. 
        Use every piece of the log
        Daemon calculates the stats, Monitor handles output and alerts
Test
    (**)Mainly test alerting logic (so that part better be pulled out)
        Use unittest package: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/
    (**)Test needs to update file over time 
    (***)Test needs to check output also
    (*)Test separate functions
Optimization
    (**)Handle any problems
        File being deleted
        Empty file
        Lines not conforming to format
    (*)Make sure application uses bounded memory
    (*)Refactor code to be modular
    (*)Maintain commenting according to PEP 8
Improvements
    (***)Come up with improvements
        While terminal output is efficient and summary statistics are useful,
        people are visual; plots and graphs would be a good addition.
Log parsing
    (DONE)Create sample logs
    (DONE)Parse out the web site section
