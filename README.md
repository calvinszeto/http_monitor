# HTTP Monitor

## Overview

    HTTP Monitor is a console application that consumes updates to an access log and outputs statistics and alerts regarding the site traffic. Currently, the monitor supports W3C Common Log format as specified here: http://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Config/Logging.html. The monitor runs on a console continuously, checking log updates at regular intervals and outputting summary statistics as well as alerts if traffic surpasses a given threshold.

## Running HTTP Monitor

Currently, the monitor is not packaged for installation. It can instead be run by cloning the source code and running the `run` script.
